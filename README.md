# <Prework-studyguide>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn the basics of coding prior to the beginning of class in order to fluently move through the beghinning stages. The purpose behind building this project was to begin coding at a beginner level while also checking our work with a step by step guide. This project solves the problem of people who never had exposure to coding now gaining experience and exposure prior to the beginning of the bootcamp. I learned throughout this prework to use basic coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also learning how to use other important tools needed for this bootcamp such as gitlab.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used as a means of quick review when getting stuck at the beginning stages of coding. instead of reading through mutiple modules this study guide will help condense the information into the pertinent information needed for using the coding learned in the prework.
